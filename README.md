# Quest
This program is capable of having a conversation with you.

#### How it works

Quest has a responce associated with each word. It looks in the input and finds the words it knows. While this approtch does work greatly most of the time, if a word is used in a **differnt context** it could lead to the program saying the wrong thing.
